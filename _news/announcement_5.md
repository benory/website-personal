I am so delighted that my article, "[Edward Lowinsky and the Divisive Politics of the _New Josquin Edition_]"(https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2025.78.2.477) has just been published in the _Journal of the American Musicological Society_. My essay draws on over five years of archival research and conversations with senior scholars in the field. I'm thankful to those who shared their memories, insights, and documents, and to the archives whose holdings made this work possible. I hope it sparks fresh discussion about the historiography of musicology and the complex legacies of its major figures.
