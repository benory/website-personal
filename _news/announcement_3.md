It's official! Iâ€™m excited to be a [Villa I Tatti](http://itatti.harvard.edu) Digital Humanities Fellow this fall at the Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies in Florence ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. I'm looking forward to working on [The 1520s Project](http://1520s-project.org) and collaborating with the other fellows.
