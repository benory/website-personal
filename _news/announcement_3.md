My [review of Jane Bernstein's <i>Printing Music in Renaissance Rome</i>](https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2024.77.3.823) has been published by the _Journal of the American Musicological Society_. As I write, it's a great book about an important--if understudied--center of music printing during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
