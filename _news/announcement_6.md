Two articles of mine hot off the press! <br><br>

My article, "[Financial Incentives for Music Scholarship: The Case of Armen Carapetyan and the American Institute of Musicology](https://doi.org/10.1525/jm.2025.42.4.452)," has been published with the _Journal of Musicology_. I show how one man’s financial resources and aesthetic preferences shaped and continue to shape the stories we tell about Renaissance music. <br><br>

A second article in the _Troja Jahrbuch_, "[Alfred Einstein’s Scholarship, the Italian Madrigal, and The Italian Madrigal](https://doi.org/10.25371/troja.v20223937)," puts Einstein's monumental publication in dialogue with surviving biographical and scholarly archival materials.
