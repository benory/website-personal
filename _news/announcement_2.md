I'm delighted that my article, "[A  Motet Wrongly Attributed to Adrian Willaert,](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.JAF.5.137256)" has just been published in vol. 16 of the _Journal of the Alamire Foundation_. It builds on findings from my volume for the Willaert edition to describe a problematic scholarly tendency to assume that an attribution in a given source can apply to works other than the one to which it is attached.
