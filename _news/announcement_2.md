I'm delighted that my article, "[A  Motet Wrongly Attributed to Adrian Willaert,](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.JAF.5.137256)" has just been published in the _Journal of the Alamire Foundation_. <br><br>

I describe a problematic scholarly tendency to assume that an attribution in a given source can apply to works other than the one to which it is attached. Closer examination of _Nigra sum_ makes clear that it is---contrary to what we've thought---a three-voice motet by an anonymous composer, with two _si placet_ (additional) voices added later.
