I'm delighted that my article, "[A  Motet Wrongly Attributed to Adrian Willaert,](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.JAF.5.137256)" has just been published in vol. 16 of the _Journal of the Alamire Foundation_. _Nigra sum_ has long been attributed to Willaert. But the motet is not as it appears: it's not by Willaert; and it was composed for three voices, with two _si placet_ (or additional) voices added later.
