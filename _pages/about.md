I received my Ph.D. in musicology from Stanford University in 2022 and have since served as visiting assistant professor in musicology at Williams College and a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford. My interests include sixteenth-century music, digital humanities, and the historiography of early music.

I’m the founder and director of the digital humanities resource, [The 1520s Project](https://1520s-project.org){:target="_blank"}, an open-source repository of 400 scores, ca. 1510–ca. 1540.

[See my CV](/assets/pdf/Ory_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more details.
