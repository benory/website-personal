Iâ€™m a music historian with interests in early music, historiography, and the digital humanities.

I'm a Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO) junior postdoctoral fellow at KU Leuven in Belgium. I received my Ph.D. in musicology from Stanford University in 2022 and have since served as a Digital Humanities Fellow at Harvard University's Villa I Tatti, as visiting assistant professor in musicology at Williams College, and as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford.

See **[my research page](/research/)** and **[my CV](/assets/pdf/Ory_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}** for more details.
