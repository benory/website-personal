I have had to subsidize, personally, all of our publications all these years… Some of the earliest titles offered (by inexperience and good faith) at a fixed subscription price and paid for many years ago but until today not yet completed have been catastrophic as costs have been rising (and indeed are rising still, especially in Europe where we produce most of our works), so that by now the prices received years ago cover not even a fourth of actual costs, without wondering about future years that the editions in question will take, at the rate we have been going, to be completed.”",Paul Sacher Stiftung,"Sammlung Clytus Gottwald, Korrespondenz -1970 [Ordner 1a + 1b] - unbearbeitet",
