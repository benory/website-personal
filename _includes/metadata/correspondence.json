This is due to rapidly increasing office work every month, while we remain critically short of hands – and we remain dispersed, which causes even more work. 1965 has completed the 20th year of my endeavors in musicology’s behalf. Without going into an account, even in the barest outline, of what these 20 years have meant in labors, vexations, worries, in health itself, I shall come to the point to say that on the financial side the 20 years have been anything but felicitous. I have had to subsidize, personally, all of our publications all these years… Some of the earliest titles offered (by inexperience and good faith) at a fixed subscription price and paid for many years ago but until today not yet completed have been catastrophic as costs have been rising (and indeed are rising still, especially in Europe where we produce most of our works), so that by now the prices received years ago cover not even a fourth of actual costs, without wondering about future years that the editions in question will take, at the rate we have been going, to be completed.”",

The same letter pointed out more clearly the inconveniences and troubles caused by delinquent editors. It was an explanation and an appeal at the same time.

Ostensibly, by the way, nothing will change, as far as the broad public is concerned. I should still be the director and still (alas!) have the full load of the work. At this moment there are 47 items in the works. Later it is more likely that the bother - ever increasing bother - of book production be alleviated by Hännsler than the AMS, Hänssler being a publisher himself. Gradually, I would hope to be relieved of editorial work. I am not immortal. On the other hand, several American musicologists have repeatedly offered to take on duties. The name too will remain. In fact, as far as the public is concerned, the AIM will be in Italy, if we continue living in this impossible place, and in Germany; and that is the way it is now.
